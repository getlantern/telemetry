# telemetry
Common library for any Go code that wants to interface with telemetry.

This expects everything to be configured via environment variables to maximize portability and flexibility.

To modify the sample rate and sampling strategy, for example, you can use:

```
OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER=parentbased_traceidratio
OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=0.001
```

See https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sdk/trace.sampling.html

To use this, you can run, for example:

```go
ctx := context.Background()
closeFunc := telemetry.EnableOTELTracing(ctx)
defer func() { _ = closeFunc(ctx) }()
```

From that point on, tracing is configured for you, and you can use it as normal. For example, you can run:

```go
tracer := otel.Tracer("my-tracer")
```

This library also contains convenience functions for forcing certain traces to be sampled. For example, to always sample HTTP requests with a specific HTTP header and value, you can run:

```go
telemetry.AlwaysSampleHeaderHandler("name", "value", otelhttp.NewHandler(...)))
```

If the value is "*", then it will always sample requests that have the header set to any value.

`telemetry` includes this ability to force traces to be sampled more generally, though. If you want to force a trace to be sampled, you can call the following to add forced sampling to its context:

```go
ctx := telemetry.AlwaysSample(r.Context())
```

That should be done for the **root span**.
